h1. My Bash Profile

This is the profile that I'm now using across a number of machines that I administer.  Most of the tricks I use are fairly general and could be reused by anyone.

h2. Personalization

This has been tweaked a bit from https://github.com/codeslinger/profile, which was cloned from https://github.com/kyleburton/profile.  Using one of those will probably be better maintained.

h2. Usage

<pre>
# Go home
cd ~

# Clone mine or your own fork
git clone git://github.com/codeslinger/profile.git .profile.d

# All *.conf files are loaded alphabetically, so this will retain your original settings
mv .profile .profile.d/z_myoldsettings.conf

# .profile.d/init kicks off the whole thing
ln -s .profile.d/init .profile

# Make sure you don't have any .bash_profile or .bashrc hanging out which might override .profile
# and reload your profile
source .profile

# If you're on Ubuntu, instead of linking .profile.d/init, you can 
# overwrite your .bashrc to simply:
# source .profile.d/init
</pre>

From here you can now put any .profile.d/<notextile>*</notextile>.conf file, or put it in a folder for your `uname` (Darwin, Linux, SunOS are already there).  The load order is.

# .profile.d/init
# .profile.d/`uname`/init
# .profile.d/<notextile>*</notextile>.conf
# .profile.d/`uname`/<notextile>*</notextile>.conf
